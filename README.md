# ML_OCR

A machine learning–based optical character recognition (OCR) project implemented in Python. This repository contains:

- `ML_OCR.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook demonstrating data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation for OCR tasks.
- `samples1000.zip`: A dataset of 1,000 labeled character images used for training and testing.

## Project Overview

This project implements a simple OCR system using classical machine learning techniques. The goal is to classify individual character images into their corresponding labels (e.g., letters A–Z).

Key steps covered in the notebook:

- Loading and inspecting the `samples1000` dataset
- Preprocessing: resizing, normalization, and train-test split
- Feature extraction using pixel intensity or simple descriptors
- Model training (e.g., Support Vector Machine, Random Forest)
- Evaluation metrics: accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report

## Dataset

The dataset is provided in `samples1000.zip`. It contains:


## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Google Colab
- Packages listed in `requirements.txt`
